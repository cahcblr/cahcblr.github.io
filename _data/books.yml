    _Rāmānuyātram_ (Rallying Behind Rāma) is a _khaṇḍa-kāvya_ of 131 verses that transforms the historic 1990 _Rāma Ratha Yātrā_ into a classical Sanskrit poetic journey. Drawing inspiration from Kālidāsa's _Raghuvaṃśa_ and _Māgha's Śiśupālavadha_, it traverses India's landscapes—its mountains, rivers, cities, and people—through the eyes of a moving chariot.

    Blending historical realism with poetic imagination, and composed predominantly in the _Vasantatilakā_ meter, the work reaffirms Sanskrit's vitality as a living medium capable of illuminating contemporary history with classical grace—uniting nationalistic spirit, devotional fervour, scholarship, and emotional depth.

    This book is a unique collection of Sanskrit stories with a modern twist, blending humor and wisdom to reflect contemporary society. Written entirely in Sanskrit, it offers readers both entertainment and enlightenment.

    The title "Śunaḥ Puccham" (Dog's Tail) is derived from the Sanskrit idiom that describes situations where there is an unexpected twist at the end—just as a dog's tail remains curved no matter how much you try to straighten it. Each story in this collection ends with such a delightful twist, challenging our expectations about everyday life.

    The book concludes with a curated list of _Subhāṣitas_ (wise sayings) relevant to the stories and essays, providing an easy reference for those keen to deepen their understanding of Sanskrit verses. Perfect for both new learners and seasoned scholars of Sanskrit.

  description: |
    A question that often arises is about positive sciences of India before the Common Era and their links with the Vedas. The present monograph brings out for the first time the Mahāsalila part of the **Vṛddhagārgīya Jyotiṣa**, critically edited from eleven manuscripts collected from libraries in India and abroad. **Salilam** is the name of the primordial state of dark-matter called andhaṁ-tamaḥ out of which all creation including the celestial bodies emerged. The **Mahāsalilam** in prose, introduces observations and quantification in terms of numbers, through a set of nearly one hundred questions and explanations, in a style that is archaic and original as emanating from the Vedic world view. Foundational concepts of astral sciences that over centuries evolved as Indian astronomy and astrology can be traced to this source in seed form. Earliest description of the five planets in terms of their brightness, six monthly lunar eclipse period, classification of comets, a theory of rainfall, instant of full moon as **pūrṇatithi**, astronomical background of the Vedic **sānnāyya**, are here. The synchronization of the five-year solar cycle with the sixty-seven sidereal lunar cycle is given. The text belongs to the **maghādi** era (c 1800-1600 BCE) when the summer solstice was with the maghā nakṣatra, centuries before the **śraviṣṭhādi** winter solstice calendar of Lagadha.

    **Nipuṇaprāghuṇakam** falls under the **Bhāṇa** genre, which is one of the ten classical forms of Sanskrit drama outlined in the **Nāṭyaśāstra**.

    Bhāṇa is considered the most challenging dramatic style in Sanskrit literature, featuring a single performer who portrays various absent characters, sustaining the story's continuity via speech, movements, and the **ākāśabhāṣita** technique—engaging in dialogue with entities not physically on stage.
