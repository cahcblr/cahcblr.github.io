History is about the Past, there is no debate on this! The controversy and loud mouthing about Vedic, Aitihāsic, Purāṇic chronology is primarily due to subjective origins for estimating/measuring (or claims of it) long time periods. Let me put it this way. We need an origin or starting point for any measurement. This cannot be a zero point (Euclidian) origin as in a high school X-Y graph. But, the European model of history introduced the imaginary origin of Christ’s-birth and in our schools we were mostly exposed to this as AD and BC, slowly changing to CE and BCE. All the same for academic (not just modern) discussions an agreed origin is needed. 

Most of us, including me, know the names of our great-grand-parents, perhaps not the tree prior to them with their dates of birth/death. I know people would say the priests in Haridwar have a record, but that is not about how as Hindus we relate to our historical past. 

We know the names of Mahāvīra, Buddha, Chāṇakya, Gupta emperors, Shankarāchārya, Mogul kings and their dates (roughly as ---AD, ---BC etc) based on evidences (inscriptions, coins, records) that can be verified in case we like to check them personally. All the same we feel happy (?) about our history in relation to Pradyota (how many know him!) Nanda, Chandragupta, Bimbisara, Ashoka, Moggalāyana, Bodhāyana and then start lecturing about Takshashila and produce a film on Chāṇakya. This is all enjoyable and gives a cozy feeling about our country, society in relation to neighbouring countries; same as position of India that is Bhārata in the world as a civilization.

How can I extend this goody-goody feeling to Krishna and Rama, that many are seeking in my generation? By this I mean how many years BP the Avatāra of Viṣṇu happened? I will not elaborate on the avatāra concept, since the emotions that rise in our “historical” relation with Aurangazeb, Samudra Gupta, Bhāsa, Kālidāsa, Mahātma Gandhi are entirely different from the feelings the characters in the Epics evoke. This is very much a defining character of the history our Hindu-Vedic Civilization.

Now, let me stop and question could there be different ways to present the past. Someone certainly thought of this and proposed; let us take 4304 BC as a start since, God created the world in that year on a Thursday (or whatever!). This has been probably given up, or limited to closed Bible study groups.  When we like to dispassionately discuss the past of a broad and widely spread society of a country (not just of my community), different notations for characterizing time would be needed. The easiest, perhaps natural is to keep our own generation as the origin and talk in terms of Before Present (BP). Archaeologists are doing so.  It is already there among biologists, anthropologists, geologists and cosmologists. Modern science has brought in Cenozoic, …Precambrian, Jurassic, Triassic,.. to communicate with the past, but still with respect to ourselves (our world) as crudely BP. 

On the other hand, astrophysicists/cosmologists assume Big Bang as the PAST zero point and imagine/model mathematically what happened at a Nano second from the zero time, to publish papers in prestigious Journals. From such speculations, a before present (BP) chronology for the Universe, solar system, Sun, continental drift, Vindhya, Tethys Sea, Himalayas, can be given in terms of Billion/Million years reaching to a few Lakhs. Some amongst us may feel that number as our society’s and as our country’s past history. There can be nothing wrong per se in any of these, except when we insist that the past should be a sum of all our ‘yesterdays’ which we frankly and fortunately, do not remember, but still argue that is what we are deducing from linguistic/scientific theories as the True history/chronology.

All the above may sound argumentative, but helps in seeing the ‘traditional point of view’ by which I mean the Vedic, purāṇic characterization of TIME as our past. The verifiable evidences for this are in the texts known and available in print (except for a rare one like the Mahāsalilam that saw the light of the day only last month!).

Vedas starting from RV know and allude to both short and long intervals of time. First about the Yuga.

Literal meaning of the word Yuga is “conjunction/coexistence/ coevality of two entities.” This may be a wooden yoke, connecting the back of two bullocks or a time period in days/years when the same two celestial bodies appear to conjunct. The word Yuga in pre-siddhānta astronomy, is usually qualified as Pañcavarṣīya-yuga, Rāhu-yuga, Bṛhaspati-yuga indicating specific periods of time. 

In RV the word Yuga and its derivatives appear more than 20 times. In some places it is an unspecified ‘time’ like generation but in some others it is an unspecified interval of years. The five year Yuga is not explicit anywhere in RV but the Vedics knew intercalation. Actually several methods were used for intercalation and hence there is no force in assuming the Five-year Yuga to be from RV. Three-year Yuga was also in vogue. Yuga in the Vedas has been used in a generic sense and to fix its value by us would be silly.  Dashame yuge (RV 1.158) need not be 40 or 50 years, it could as well refer to the ninth decade of life. Forms such as yuge-yuge, yugāni, uttare yuge, pūrve yuge, prathame yuge (10.72) point clearly to an interval of time in years; multiple of which was meant in plural. Devānām yuga/Prathama yuga would be the ‘time’ of First Creation. Triyugam purā (10.97) Chaturyuga (2.18) are also used. The value of time meant is not clear, but to argue - triyugam pura means “15 years before, because yuga could not have been longer than five” - lacks logic. RV has contemporaneous information; names of kings, dānastuti, battles, sages, their progeny etc that may be worthy to be marked in ‘historical time’. But in RV+ other Vedic texts there is too much content concerning what we may today denote as natural history and science.

The Vedic cosmological hymns (RV 10.72, 121, 129; also in TS and SB) are extremely important for all later literature (and Vedic-Hinduism) because all creation started from an unquantifiable, but still perceived and articulated as The Beginning, when the Golden Egg split on the fluidic dark-matter (andhe-tamasi). Some of these statements sound contradictory, as words cannot unequivocally convey the very First. The esoteric idea of a quantified zero/singularity had not yet bloomed. Along with the Big-Split, sentient emanation of Brahman, Brahma, Pracetas, Prajāpati, phenomenal time, Vatsara, Samvatsara are cognized to have happened self-similarly.

The Vedic texts are voluminous, amorphous, packed with information, tantalizingly coded with multiple meanings, except for number counts that remain in the realm of nonlinguistic natural truths (paśyantī level) that is invariant for us also. So if mānuṣa yuga is mentioned it is reasonable to take this as a maximum 100 years. But daiva yuga could be much longer but no estimate of Time to Creation is available in the Vedas till we come to the Purāṇas. But let there be no confusion, the Vedic texts do refer to long year durations (not just any large number). This we see (PFA) in the Atharvaveda (8.2.21) 

Several scholars have interpreted this as they like, nevertheless all recognize that this hymn is about time/life period in years (hāyana), perhaps 100, ayuta may be 10000 (Lakh?) and then something done two, three and four times. What is this, if not the seed for the long Purāṇic Yuga concept? My intention is not to make meaning of the above Vedic hymn, but to show that the concept of long periods of time called ‘Yuga’ (juxtaposed with numbers 2,3,4) is already there in the Vedas, unless one chooses to close one’s eyes.  The Taittirīya and the Shatapatha Brāhmaṇa allude to 1000 year satra that is imaginary, but then the priests are talking of long time periods and not of carrying out a sacrifice like the Devatās did in Kurukṣetra (Maitrāyaṇi Samhita), that is a clear metaphor for a large scale natural disaster.

The Purāṇas have carried on the above ‘Time/Kāla’ concepts in their own fashion still retaining the Universal or cosmic vision/ideal, that is denoted as sanātana-dharma.

There is a Sanskrit adage sthitasya gatiḥ chintanīyā. Translated roughly this means, we have to engage with and possibly benefit from what is in front of us, not decry or demean. There is no point in blaming the Purāṇas as having lead Hindus to low IQ, like some history/chronology judges WUI.  With 18 major and 18 minor Purāṇas and the two epics it is nobody’s case that these texts are coherent and agree with each other. Much of the material is floating stuff, scum on the surface. One has to avoid getting stuck in this quick sand, if one has to draw some useful conclusions. 

Even per the orthodox tradition MBh was edited twice from the original Jaya (8800 verses); to Bhārata (24,000) and then expanded as MBh of one Lakh verses. We have to grapple with this truth in extracting history from the Epic. M.R.Yardi has demonstrated that there may be actually five recognizable layers in the final MBh, that has been endorsed by the editors and other scholars of repute. To claim the BORI Critical Edition to be the actual or real MBh for historical purposes and for dating the War, goes against the strong Hindu (historical) tradition that Jaya was the original and also against scientific analysis of authorship signatures. 

So, what is the sanctity behind the date of MB war as 5100, 3102 or 2782, 1790, 1478 BCE (the last one is my value!). There will be myriad things to read and write about the 200-400 Sanskrit Texts, that form the warp and woof of Hindu culture. This is like exploring an ocean or a wild hilly forest. In many places it is calm, beautiful but as you go deeper in some places it can be fiery, harsh and scary. For the present, I restrict to only TIME as a concept continued from the Vedic texts, in the purāṇa paleontology.

First, one has to have a broad understanding of the growth of the bulky texts. My premise is that the Purāṇas have grown (like MBh above) from a single seed text (purāṇa samhitā?) from the Vedas (text with accent vs that without accent). In my assessment, among the available texts Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa (BP) is the closest to the Vedas. Like with other texts, parts got added at different times by different people and now we have three parts (first & second are better linked, the 3rd is unconnected) in BP. 

The first part, the earliest is largely free of the two human Avatāras of Viṣṇu, but has references to, creation of Life, Dhruva as the Polestar, the four Yugas and the manvantaras. It has the best Meru-centric astronomy model, yet to be critically explored. It has a fleeting reference to river Godāvari and Rāma but that chapter on geography with China, Tuṣāra, Bāhlīka is a later addition. Similar is the Vāyu Purāṇa with 2 parts, which some consider to be the earliest. In the second part (uttarārdha) we find Rāma and Kṛṣṇa mentioned in brief, while the pūrvārdha is free of the aitihāsica avatāras.

My working hypothesis is that the shortest of the Purāṇas are the early ones to which parts have been added at later periods in different regions of Greater India. Over some 1000 years, parallel social consolidation movements and sectarianism, increased the numbers to 18 MahaP+18 UpaP. The cliché of vaiṣṇava, śaiva, śākta classification largely masks the Vedic majesty of describing the Cosmos, sṛṣṭi, sthiti, laya, Uni-theism (not Poly, nor Mono) as encompassing all the Devatās (viśvarūpa) and TIME as Brahman (Maitrāyaṇi Āraṇyaka). Still, many Vedic tangibles (ex: Vedic–Dhruva the Polestar circa 3000 BC) are retrievable in the Purāṇas, if you dig and sieve patiently. 

The following three bullet points emerge repeatedly:
1. Intellectual effort in threading and weaving a plausible timeline, following the Vedic ākhyāna style (reasoning through story telling!) starting presumably from the First Creation/Golden Egg-splitting i.e. the Big bang of the Vedas.  
2. Tension in rejoicing and depicting Kṛṣṇa (avatāra of Viṣṇu) as human, who is nevertheless The Paramātman; the all-pervasive Antaryāmin.
3. Combining the above two as a self-sustaining dynamo for the sanātana dharma, with many regional, sectarian corollaries added over centuries.
   
This is a minimalistic picture, but if you know that in organic systems, like Hinduism in reality is, period three-implies-chaos. But chaos is not white noise or lack of order; it is only fine structured self-similarity as per Prajāpati’s Manas.  Sanātana is basically characterization of TIME as primeval, perpetual, eternal. This word in the sense of very ancient is traceable to the Shatapatha Brāhmaṇa.
Where does history come into picture here?

History (intermediate or 100, 1000 year scale chronology) as we call it today, was not the central theme of the Purāṇas. Still here and there, time in centuries, like the interval between Parikshit and the Nandas as 1050 years shows up in some Purāṇas. For them, this was sufficient, as societally inherited information, to believe in the historicity of Krishna and the associated MBh characters. Since the human avatāra was the Parabrahman, the contradiction was ironed out by making the texts a-historical (but not un- or anti-historical) in the cosmological time frame of the yugas expanded to manvantaras, Kalpa, half-day of Brahma.

It was important to keep a notional origin as the first creation for which the long time periods (self-similar repetitions) mimicking eclipses, comet appearances, long term floods came handy. This model is derived from Vedic concepts only, including but not limited to Viśvedevāḥ, Ka-prajāpati, cosmology, self-similar evolution, bardic genealogy, some real events, extra-terrestrial impacts and observations. If we sample the Vedas, Purāṇas, epics for realistic astronomical observations (assuming the Sanskrit text to be uncorrupted and we do not hair-split driven by rightist or leftist agenda) and be able to date them, footprints on the sands of time can be gleaned. This would be a BP year value (based on modern celestial mechanics) for some human groups to have read the skies.

The cultural groups associated with such celestial descriptions were at least not later than the resulting BP year. (They might have lived before and passed on a legend, recorded later). If you derive this way the date of the Kurukshetra war or Krishna’s birth date, there is no harm, because it is textual and we can be satisfied knowing that Rāma and Krishna were Great historical personages, although all the embellishment around them might be layered stories and paddings through legends.  But if the event is couched in the Cosmological time line and named as itihāsa, the perception of a PAST EVENT related to our generation as human beings vanishes, but has to be imagined mentally/emotionally (bhāvanā) as from the first creation, starting from the Svāyambhuva manvantara (Era of the Self-created). This is the first era (each era is about 300 million yrs) of the kalpa with 14 manvantaras which is about 4.3 billion years in total length. Many Indian texts have attempted this type of Creationistic art or science so as not to be bogged down by the earthly (Pārthiva) frailties of Rāma or Krishna or Shiva but treat them to be transcendental for cultivating devotion towards them as antaryāmi. Further explanation of this leads to Uni-theistic Vedānta metaphysics (jñāna and bhakti as the two modes of human psyche to be kept in synchrony through dhārmic-karma) which is not the current topic.

Vedic-Hindus maintain (unknowingly or unwittingly?) to this day, their link to the putative Bigbang TIME through the routine Saṅkalpa “…ādya brahmaṇah dvitīya-parārdhe śri śvetavarāhakalpe, vaivasvata-manvantare (28-tame) kaliyuge, prathame pāde,….śakābde, ….asminvartamāne, vyāvahārike.…samvatsare….Ṛtau, māse, pakshe, Nakṣatre, tithau, vāsare…Śrimannarāyaṇa/ŚriParameshwara/….prītyartham….rudrābhshekam/Kṛshnajayantī- pūjām/ yajñopavītadhāraṇam/…darśa-śrāddham/uttarāyaṇa-puṇyakāle pitṛtarpaṇam/……kariṣye”

Note carefully, if you see the above in reverse order, mainly Three Time parameters are here; the local calendar date and time; intermediate (historical) time in years (śakābda, Vi. samvatsara, kaliyuga); long time in manvantara, reaching parārdha. All the three are important parts of Kāla in the religious Hindu saṅkalpa and have to be correct as envisioned in the Vedas, but modulated over millennia. This is quantification of Time in three scales Before Present (BP). In current practice some of the above numbers are glaringly wrong and should be corrected. But the inbuilt concept of evolutionary, natural, tectonic, human, calendar (history) linked to personal time, cannot be denied. Unfortunately, some of our own scholars declare that for Hindus time is circular/periodic and it is made longer only by multiplying with planetary periods. Such negations are based on ignorance and inability to feel the common spiritual/dhārmic thread passing through the texts they read or ignore. 
First, I will consider the intermediate time scale, that has spurred contemporary Bhāratīyas to delineate their identity as the followers or otherwise of the Vedic-Purāṇic Past.

Curiosity to know where Agni, Indra, Vibhāvasu, Mātariśvan, Mitra, Varuṇa, Achyuta, Dhruva, Samvatsara, Kalpa, Rudra, Māruti, Viṣṇu, Lakshmi, Umā, Saraswati, Uśanas, Vasiṣṭha, Viswamitra, Agastya, Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, Gaṇapati, Skanda, Anumati, Kuhū, etc etc fit-in in the above grandstand saṅkalpa time line is a legitimate desire.

The above list of names is only a sample! All these words/names and hundred more, appear in the Vedic texts and also in the Purāṇas & Epics. Kāla and deśa manifest together; accordingly, we have to recognize, dyauh, antarikṣa and pṛthivī as the strata on which the above names/adjectives/objects/states/forces/devatā have existence. For human history it makes sense only to ask about what is on pṛthivi that is generally (not in all contexts) equated with earth. It is important to note the names of many kings and sages are also the names of devatas in the Vedas. One has to be careful in this scenario about whether we are talking about personified celestial objects or about our human ancestors, Kings/ Sages/Gotra Ṛṣis. Very often this is mixed up. This is primarily due to the Vedic ideal (dayuh pitā, pṛthivī mātā); the life on earth seeded by cosmic waters and a return cycle of life (ātma/souls) reaching sukṛtinām lokaḥ. (Some Purāṇas specify which part of the sky will be reached by āhitagnis, Somapās, etc.). Details will be a drag on the readers and I pass further explanation on this!

For our current interest we note that the Vedic Tai. Araṇyaka clearly says, the Saptaṛṣis and Agastya (Ursa Major & Canopus) are blessed, being with the stars, that carry the same names. This indicates that these eight Sages were on earth also like us and the constellations were named after them by the Vedic society. Such statements can be of help in astronomical dating of the culture. The above text also describes the Śiśumāra (Draco) constellation with fourteen stars, the last one Abhaya (modern Thuban/α-Dra) being stationary w.r.t other stars to be called Achyuta, Dhruva. Such an observation would have been possible only in (2850±100) BCE. The above Vedic text is followed now mainly in South India. But we can say that historically some ancestors of this Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda followers had made the above observation near Kurukshetra. In any case the above date is the only reference anchor for cultural history before 3000 BCE and also for later events.

Axial precession of Earth is a reality, like sunrise and sunset. No culture escapes this and in some manner this would be expressed if the ancients had carefully observed the sky and surroundings for a few generations. Again the Maitrayaṇīya Āraṇyaka of the KYV records the questions of King Bṛhadratha, who laments about the transient nature of life along with a sequence of sixteen of his predecessors; Sudyumna, Bhuridyumna, Indradyumna, Kuvalayāsva, Yauvanāśva, Vadhrya, Aśvapati, Śaśabindu, Hariścandra, Ambarīṣa, Nanaktu, Śaryāti, Yayāti, Anaraṇya, Akṣasena + (older) Marutta and Bharata before them. The King wonders why even Dhruva moves, which can only be the felt effect of precession, notwithstanding the belief of his predecessors that the Pole Star remained stationary. With further data in the text about Dakṣiṇāyana being from Maghā nakṣatra to half-śraviṣṭha, the above episode can be dated to around 1800 BCE. (For details please read my papers in the Ind. J History of Science and the recent book Mahāsalilam.). Beyond reasonable doubt, the above kings were historical and lived prior to the above epoch.

Archaeo-astronomical study of the Sanskrit texts is the only rigorous and objective approach for Hindus to arrive at BP/BCE years prior to Gautama Buddha and Chāṇakya. This method sensitively depends on the data that one feeds into the modern astronomical equations/algorithms/software. Error estimation is possible and the results can be verified by others once the meanings of the Sanskrit texts are agreed upon as honest and correct. If multiple meanings crop up, the resulting multiple dates have to be discussed for acceptance or rejection. With a text layered like MBh, many astronomical statements could appear inconsistent. For example: Śanaiśchara (Saturn) being near Rohiṇi and also said to be near Viśākha within a few verses in the Bhīṣma Parvan leads to strong divergence of opinion among the chronologists of the MB war.

If the textual geographical names of towns, villages, forests, lakes, coastlines are believed to be same as the current names, archaeology would be helpful. Excavations and consistent match of textual data with stratigraphy and cultural artefacts can lead to probable dates. Example:  Drying of River Sarasvati is described in the Skānda Purāṇa, MBh and other texts. This can be verified scientifically to present day standards on ground in the Brahmāvarta region, to have happened circa 4000 BP or around 2000 BCE. The texts have perpetuated the memory of this slow natural event in umpteen different ways and there is no denial that this has remained in the societal memory of Indians to this day, like the story of the child prince Dhruva of the Vishnu purana and Bhagavata.

The above may not always be possible, since displaced people usually name their new settlements with previous city/village/river names of fond memory. In some of the Purāṇas this shows up as discontinuity/contradictions in the geo-environment, supposedly of the same sacred site. Thus, ASI may be digging in the wrong place for the original Dvāraka/Prabhāsa of MBh and the Harivamsha!

Genealogy studies arrive at broad and rather hazy picture of the historicity of the epic heroes. For example, if you ask whether the Ambarisha mentioned above by Bṛhadratha, is same as the one who promoted ekādaśi vrata of the Bhāgavata there will be confusion. That Rāma was earlier than Kṛṣṇa will be quite clear from the texts. But the linkages between the two as per the Uttarakāṇḍa and Harivamśa are not same and this will necessitate lot of special pleading for consistency.

Yāskāchārya in the Nirukta makes a sarcastic comment: If a blind man hits his head against a pillar, whose fault is it; of the pillar or of the person? He was referring to persons of his time (c1000 BCE?) who argued that the Vedas have no meaning. Now, his remark is relevant to all of us as Hindus, with our diverse inherited practices (sampradāya) on one side and Vedas still learnt orally and preserved (paraṁpara) diligently on the other side. The meanings of the Vedic texts including the śrauta practices are not remembered without confusion.  Some selected Purāṇas and the epics being so popular, (even at street level), we have difficulty in placing the canonical texts and the dhārmic practices at large, in intellectual and emotional balance.

All said and done Hinduism is not a book based religious culture. Nevertheless, the texts are the repositories of our treasured unitary Vedic paraṁpara and the myriad saṁpradāyas that together make up for sanātana dharma. This is a dicey situation, since we don’t know what texts have been lost or still catching dust in a manuscript library.

Talking about our not too distant past, one should wonder why a mleccha name appears and elapsed years are recollected as śakābda in the religious saṅkalpa.  The only reason can be, in my opinion; we are here recollecting the most turbulent period of Hinduism, when outsiders (Scythians) invaded and destroyed Pāṭaliputra, Sāketa, and Avanti (100BC-100AD). The famous purāṇas do not have much to say on this period, but some of the Sanskrit dramas and Jaina texts allude to this period.

There is also a tiny text with just 115 verses, called “Yugapurāṇa” that provides some real history. This purāṇa is like a conversation between Śiva and Skanda said to be from Skānda Puraṇa. This short YP text was submerged as a part of the Vrddhagarga Samhita/Jyotisha, but pulled out and edited first by [Mankad (1950)](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.8341) and later by [Mitchiner (1986)](https://archive.org/details/TheYugaPurana).

As per YP, the first Kṛtayuga ended with the Tārakā war, (devāsura yuddha a metaphor for a disturbed sky and extra-terrestrial impacts causing disasters in India). The Tretāyuga ended with Rāma destroying kṣatriyas 21 times, that is a reference to Paraśurāma of MBh.  Keśava (Vāsudeva), Pāṇḍavas were at the closing part of Dwāpara, whereas Janamejaya Pārikṣita (s/o Parīkṣit) was at the start of Kaliyuga. This yuga gradually transitioned after the Yavanas and Śakas were pushed back. Northern India was devastated by famine, followed by people resettling peacefully in twelve different regions of India, waiting for a new Yuga! 

I am not working out any chronology, but I like to point out that this text (critically edited with translation by Mitchiner available on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/TheYugaPurana) ) is available for anyone, particularly those against the Purāṇas, to read and ponder about how and why śakābda got mandated into our dhārmic vocabulary.

It may be inferred that YP and other relatively short Purāṇas originated from the same single ancient source. The popular Purāṇas when scripted in the royal courts, were expanded in their size and also in Yuga numbers, so that they become para-historical or a-historical (see [Post-4](#p4) ) by design. Several other smṛti, āgama texts also appear para-historical with their authorship ascribed to Vedic Sages: Vasiṣṭha, Kaśyapa, Parāśara, Agastya, Nārada, Viśvāmitra, Hārita, Yājñavalkya etc. 

I have wondered very often why so; were the primary level Purāṇa-kartas unethical? Or did they have a greater ideal in front of them for some special purpose. To me it appears they had set for themselves to give to the society a taste of what had been lost due to some apocalyptic disaster and destruction, denoted by the generic word Pralaya. The people directly bearing the brunt could not have left any record. Only the survivors gathering their lives and spiritual strength could have said or written about their past. Possibly the School of Vyāsa not only organized the family traditions of the Vedas for proper preservation, but also sowed the seeds for the Purāṇas meant for public teaching in the story telling tradition. We have no access to the original deliberations, but the text of Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa gives some clues to this.

A very powerful word Śiṣṭāchāra (śiṣṭānāṁ āchāraḥ i.e practice of Śiṣṭas) is usually cited by traditional scholars when questioned about some peculiar socio-religious practices. The word Śiṣṭa in current Sanskrit (rūdhyartha) means noble/ pious/ learned/ knowledgeable. But the earlier etymological meaning was ‘remainder / left back’ as per the Purāṇa.

    शेषशब्दः शिष्ट  इति शेषं शिष्टं प्रचक्षते | 
    मन्वन्तरेषु ये शिष्टाः इह तिष्ठन्ति धार्मिकाः || (BP.1.32.37). 
    
The word Smṛti is also defined as what is remembered from previous Yugas. Not everything can be written down nor remembered. Thus, this permitted flexibility in time but bound by eight principles (lakṣaṇa) of this dhārmic Śiṣṭāchāra (BP.1.32.41). These are declared as dāna, satya, tapas, jñāna, vidyā, ijyā, vrajana, dayā. [ijyā is Pooja/worship, vrajana is yātra/ renunciation/ resettlement.] 
The endlessly lectured pañcha lakṣaṇa, viz. sarga, pratisarga, vaṁśa, manvantara, vamśānucharita are there, but these are supporting structures to promote and continue the practice of the above eight principles, bequeathed by our most ancient ancestors as the essentials of sanātana dharma.

The word Sanātana refers to TIME which is ancient, primeval, perpetual, eternal, …To me it is clear, Vedic-Hinduism promoted by the Purāṇas, Epics and the āgamas, expect sanātana-dharma followers to willy-nilly connect themselves mentally (Prāṇāyāma is mandatory before every saṅkalpa, which has now largely vanished or reduced to touching the nose.) with the First Matter/ Creation/ Creator as their source! One among Viṣṇu’s 1000 name in MBh is sanātsanātanatamaḥ; ancient-est than the ancient. It is not that this is a dictum in vacuum only for those who sit closing their eyes and ears. Hinduism helps humans with 100-year life-scale, to link elegantly and objectively with a very long time scale, as part of dhārmic practice.

The Sāligrāma in our temples and homes is direct manifestation of Viṣṇu; no prāṇapratiṣṭhā is needed for ritualistic worship, unlike with large granitic icons. I have not seen any specific Vedic statement about this śilā, even though there may be a tenuous link to agni, makhā etc. In the Garuḍa Purāṇa and in some āgama texts Sāligrāmas are extolled. How and why did this practice spread all over India? Is it purely by chance or is there any etiological significance? You can say without contradiction, if you are a votary of modern science, that the avatāra of Viṣṇu as Ammonites/ Sāligrāma-śila happened during 500 million years ago (Mya) till 66 Mya.

The first initiators of the above obviously knew primitive life forms also to be a mode of Viṣṇu and selected Sāligrāma to represent a very ancient period (manvantara) symbolically in the course of a Hindu’s life. One can say that for āstikas it is not sufficient to know only the Purāṇa stories of child Kṛṣna for developing Bhakti, but they have to ponder about the origin of life and earth also.

I speculate about the possibility of a Vedic link for the above. In several of the Vedic rituals (ex: agnichayana, pravargya) an important sambhāra (component) is the valmīka-vapā. This is the special mud from a termite mound. Too many esoteric concepts are here and I will not go into them; but just note that the Vedas laud vamrī (termites) as the first born of this creation on earth (devīrvamrīrasya bhūtasya prathamajā ṛtavarīḥ T.A. 4.2.3). Modern science says this life form evolved about 250 Mya. 
The above is not an isolated case. The Skānda Purāṇa in the Prabhāsakhaṇḍa, describes an ancient extraterrestrial impact as part of the physical features of the region. This also provides the etiology for worshipping Liṅga, commonly taken to be Śiva’s phallus fallen on ground.

The puraṇas have come down to us in a storytelling mode, through the survivors. Hence, here again Yāska’s caution about hitting our head against a pillar has to be kept in mind, while retrieving natural history of Vedic Hinduism from the above Purāṇa. Here I just give a summary:

| One, who is called Kālāgni-rudra, by the followers of the Vedas, is in Prabhāsa, named Bhairava.   When Agni (Fire) burnt continuously for a length of four yugas in the Megha-vāhana Kalpa a liṅga came into existence there. This liṅga has three names, Agnimīdha, Kālāgni-rudra and Agni-īśāna. The legend of a part of Sun falling down in Prabhāsa appears in the 11th chapter, where Sun’s birth itself is put at the beginning of the present Śvetavarāha Kalpa, that would be 1975 million years ago.

The descent of the Sun (ET impacts) is said to be in the Svārociṣa manvantara that works out to be 1665 Mya. The sea near Prabhāsa receded for thousand years and overflowed after a long time. All of this cosmogony is combined with the vanishing of River Saraswati in a picturesque and poignant style. [For details please see](https://cahc.jainuniversity.ac.in/assets/ijhs/Vol39_1_2_RNIyengar.pdf)

The interesting point is that the text says a part of Sun fell at Prabhāsa (This place is not the present day Somanath, near Verawal).  The text also identifies that out of the first fifteen parts of Sun, the discus of Viṣṇu, the trident of Śiva, the spear of Skanda, the weapons of all the gods and demons got formed. (PK 11.195-205).  This is an allusion to the celestial origin and inspiration for some of the sacred religious symbols. 
The message is that Purāṇas have thought out a lot on cosmos, creation, Vedas, birth, death, and disasters for formulating sanātana dharma and its philosophy of Upaniṣads for balancing action, emotion and the intellect. Not only the modern evolutionary history of life forms but also the natural history of the Raṇ (Iriṇa), Sharavana, Arāvali region is reflected in the Ṛgveda and the Purāṇa.

The Vedic MAU, declares TIME started (that is measurement) after the manifestation of Sun, that per the Skānda Purāṇa happened 2.3 Billion years ago. The Vedic dictum is kālam brahmetyupāsīta (TIME should be worshipped / contemplated as Brahman). True to this, the primary sources of sanātana dharma have information for understanding our past history chronologically at least up to 4th mill. BCE and before that the natural history of the Brahmāvarta region, contemplating through the Vedas towards cosmogony of the solar system.

As we seek and study our history, many unanswered questions arise about ancient India. But paradoxically while the long period yuga, kalpa are all fine as sanātanis, our short time parameters as practicing Hindus, have gone horribly wrong. When the Vedic uttarāyaṇa-puṇyakāla day (for pitṛ-tarpaṇa) is declared to be the makara-sankrānti day even by religious institutions, what has happened to Hinduism as a discerning intellectual culture? Why have we accepted to be led by the words of panchangas and astrologers rather than by direct observation of Sun in the spirit of the Vedas and the Puraṇas?

> **PS: In December 2023, I had organized at CAHC-Jain Univ., a two-day meeting with several traditional Vedic scholars that included discussions on some of the long, intermediate, and short term historical issues of Vedic culture. I am glad to inform, that one of the participants Vid. Shriramaṇa Sharma of Nerur, is organizing a discussion meeting today in Chennai on exactly the last topic! I am not participating but sent a note for discussion. I hope some positive action point emerges as the first step in self healing.
