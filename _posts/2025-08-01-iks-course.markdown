### 1. Foundations of Indian Knowledge

*   **Method of Indian Knowledge (Yukti *Reason/Logic*)**:
    *   Understanding *Śāstra* (*Science*): Description of *Lakṣaṇa* (*Nature*), verification, and testing.
    *   How ancestors thought: Observation, inference, old records, and legends as sources of knowledge.
    *   The power of *Yukti* in achieving life-goals (*Dharma, Artha, Kāma*) and in validating knowledge; its primacy over *Āgama* (*Vedas/Authority*) if contradictions arise.
    *   The dynamic nature of *Siddhānta* (*theories*): new theories are created when older ones lose accuracy.
    *   The process of maintaining tradition through correlation of computation with observation and logical inference.
    *   Indian approach to science: "Worship the phenomenon, not the explanation".
*   **Indian Philosophy (Darśana *Point of View*)**:
    *   Core philosophical inquiries: Ontology ("What is really there?") and Epistemology ("How to know it?") (*Prameya-pramāṇa*).
    *   Upanishads as the fountainhead of Indian Philosophy: Concepts of 5 *Koṣas* (*sheaths*) and 3 *Avasthās* (*states of consciousness*).
    *   Understanding *Māyā* (*illusion*) and *Avidyā* (*ignorance*).
    *   Survey of major philosophical schools and their perspectives on sadness and happiness:
        *   **Cārvāka (Lokāyata)**: Materialism, maximizing happiness in this life.
        *   **Sāmkhya-Yoga**: Distinction between *Puruṣa* (*Consciousness*) and *Prakṛti* (*mind-body*), with practical application through Yoga.
        *   **Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika**: Logic and atomism, decoupling the 'real I' from mind-body.
        *   **Pūrvamīmāṃsā**: Focus on *Karma* (*actions*) prescribed by the Vedas, performed without desire for reward.
